						<span class="title">Data Acquisition Add-on</span>
						<p> The Data Acquisition Add-on is a firmware upgrade which adds three extra features: </p>
<!--						<div class="list star col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span>Saves time on imaging.</span>
							<span>Retrieves more data from problematic drives.</span>
							<span>Increases transparency through more detailed logging mechanisms.</span>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="block">
						<span class="title subtitle">Investigate while imaging!</span>
						<p>
							The process is very simple:
						</p>-->
						<div class="list counts col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span style="content: '3'">Ability to recover data to an image file.</span>
						</div>
						<p>The standard RapidSpar device recovers data sector by sector, making an exact copy of the Source drive. With the Data Acquisition Add-on, recovered data can be optionally written to a raw DD image file on the Target drive.</p>
						<div class="list counts col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span>A highly flexible new mode of operation in which RapidSpar acts as an advanced write blocker with on-the-fly imaging and data recovery capabilities.</span>
						</div>
						<p>In this mode the host computer is connected to RapidSpar over USB3, while RapidSpar has a direct SATA connection to Source and Target drives. The RapidSpar device employs a drive emulation system to present itself exactly as the original Source drive to the host computer. Here is how it works:
						</p>
						<div class="list star col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span>RapidSpar copies all identification parameters from the Source drive and uses them to identify itself to the host computer. This allows any third party software to work with RapidSpar as if it was a standard USB3 hard drive.</span>
							<span>Blocks of sectors requested by the host computer are recovered from the Source by RapidSpar, saved to the image file on the Target drive, and then sent to the host.</span>
							<span>Secondary host requests for previously imaged sectors will be automatically served by the Target drive, ensuring that we read each sector from the Source drive only once.</span>
							<span>Whenever the Source drive is idling, RapidSpar can use the time to fill in previously unread sectors to complete the image.</span>
						</div>
						<p>
						If the Source drive gets stuck processing a bad block of sectors, the RapidSpar device will: 
						</p>
						<div class="list star col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span>Automatically reset and/or repower the drive as needed to minimize further degradation.</span>
							<span>Optionally retry the bad block one sector at a time to maximize data retrieval.</span>
							<span>Fill in any unreadable sectors with a user defined pattern to track corruption.</span>
							<span>Assemble the requested block using all available data and send it to the host as the response to the original block read request.</span>
						</div>						
						<p>
						The host computer maintains a problem-free, uninterrupted connection to the emulated Source drive at all times, even while the real Source is being repowered! This ensures that the computer will never freeze, crash, restart, or drop the connection due to problems with the Source drive. Bad sector processing will be from 5 to 25+ times faster and safer in comparison with using software directly on the Source drive. 
						<p>
						All of this functionality is provided entirely by the standalone RapidSpar device with no software or hardware requirements for the host computer. 
						</p>

						<div class="list counts col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span>Extra reporting that accounts for integrity of specific files.</span>
						</div>
							<p>RapidSpar maintains a live sector map within its project metadata saved on the built-in SSD inside the RapidSpar device. With the Data Acquisition Add-on, this sector map can be parsed to create a .csv file which shows a file listing with the exact number of good and bad sectors within each recovered file. This information is usually used to communicate the results of the recovery to the customer to increase transparency and prevent conflicts.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<!--<div class="block">
						<span class="title color subtitlesub">How does it work?</span>
						<p>
							The RapidSpar device employs a powerful drive emulation system to present itself exactly as the original write-blocked Source drive would to the host computer. As such, any software will identify and work with RapidSpar as if it were the original Source drive.
						</p>
						<p>
							You can safely start analyzing the data as soon as you receive the Source drive while RapidSpar seamlessly handles imaging in the background! 
						</p>
						<div class="list star col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span>Blocks of sectors requested by the host computer are read from the Source by RapidSpar, saved to the image file on the Target drive, and then passed back to the host. </span>
							<span>Whenever the Source drive is idling, RapidSpar can use the time to work toward making a complete image. </span>
							<span>Automatic file system mounting processes used by most operating systems can be blocked by the RapidSpar device to reduce the number of unnecessary reading operations and give your forensics software a higher priority for data access. </span>
						</div>
						<p>
							All of this functionality is provided entirely by the standalone RapidSpar device with no software or hardware requirements for the host computer.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="block">
						<span class="title subtitle">Recover more data from unstable drives!</span>
						<p>
							RapidSpar will automatically handle read instabilities whether it is used as an advanced write blocker with only the Source drive, or as an imager with both Source and Target drives. 
						</p>
						<p>
							If the Source drive gets stuck processing a bad block of sectors, the RapidSpar device will:
						</p>
						<div class="list counts col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span>Automatically reset or repower the drive as needed to minimize further degradation.</span>
							<span>Retry the same block one sector at a time to maximize data retrieval.</span>
							<span>Fill any unreadable sectors with a user defined pattern for easy identification with forensics tools.</span>
							<span>Assemble the single sector results back into the requested block.</span>
						</div>
                        <p></p>
                        <p></p>
						<p>
							During this entire process the host computer maintains an uninterrupted connection to the emulated Source drive (even while the real Source is being repowered!) and remains entirely unaware that anything unusual has happened, to ensure that there won't be any unexpected problems from system software or hardware which are not designed to deal with read instabilities. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="block">
						<span class="title subtitle">Logs that account for integrity of specific files!</span>
						<p>
							RapidSpar offers detailed metadata:
						</p>
						<div class="list star col-md-11 col-sm-11 col-xs-11 col-md-offset-1 col-sm-offset-1 col-xs-offset-1">
							<span>RapidSpar maintains a live sector map within its project metadata saved on the built-in SSD inside the RapidSpar device. </span>
							<span>In addition to the standard report that outlines the basic details of the case and all actions taken by the investigator, a .csv file can be generated that will contain the list of all sectors which are unreadable or unprocessed in the current case. </span>
							<span>This metadata can be parsed further with the RapidSpar Assistant software to create a more detailed .csv report containing the exact numbers of integral and missing sectors within each recovered file.</span>
