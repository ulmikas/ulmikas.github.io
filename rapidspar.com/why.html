                        <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">
                            <p>
                                How is RapidSpar able to recover 50% of the cases data recovery software tools fail on? It has direct access to drives, unlike software recovery tools that have to work through layers of generic hardware and system software. Here’s why that matters so much.
                            </p>
		        <span class="tit orange">Software tools: Dependent on computer hardware/BIOS/OS</span>
                            <p>
                                Standard computers are designed with overall system stability as the main goal. To operate reliably and predictably, they work with drives only within the strict confines of the standard ATA protocol. This imposes limits on software data recovery tools, which have to use the computer’s generic hardware and system software (BIOS/OS) to access damaged drives.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                When a drive starts to degrade, it loses the ability to abide by the rules of the ATA protocol, and the computer’s hardware and system software are not designed to handle such deviations. This may lead to any number of exceptions, causing the system to freeze or restart, fail to identify the drive, intermittently drop the connection to the drive, or work too slowly for meaningful data to be recovered.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To begin working with drives, standard computers send a large number of initialization commands, such as Set UDMA Transfer Mode, Initialize S.M.A.R.T., Initialize Device, Recalibrate and so on. If a drive is degraded, it may fail to respond to all of these commands within the expected timeframe, which usually leads to a failure to identify the drive. This doesn't mean the drive has actually failed, or even that it has any serious problems — it's just that its degraded firmware subsystem has failed to process one of these initializations commands in the exact way it was expected to.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Furthermore, most of these initialization commands are unnecessary for modern hard drives and only create a potential for problematic behavior. They are a part of the initialization process in standard computers because they are necessary for older drives. Standard computers do not make any distinction between older and newer drives, and instead always use the most complex initialization process to support the largest number of drives.
                            </p>
		        <span class="tit orange">RapidSpar: Keeping it simple</span>
                            <p>
                                RapidSpar uses the lightest initialization procedure in each case, which for most modern drives is a single Disk Identification command. RapidSpar is also built to be much more forgiving of possible deviations in the drive's response, ensuring that there are no unexpected problems and that only truly failed drives are unidentified.
                            </p>
		        <span class="tit orange">Software tools: Indirect access causes big problems</span>
                            <p>
			    Software data recovery tools do not have direct control or exclusive access to the drive. Software tools can only send read commands to the OS API; with luck, the communication attempt passes through each layer of system software without any issues, and the drive is capable of consistently processing read commands.
                            </p>

                            <p>
			But if the drive isn’t operating as expected, communication can break down at any point, halting the recovery effort. If the read command falls on a bad sector, for example, software tools do not have any say in how this is handled; that part will be decided by layers of system software that the software tool can’t control.
		        </p>
                            <p>
			The best-case scenario is that the computer waits until the drive responds to the read command on its own. This means every time the read command falls on a bad sector, the drive will spend 3-7 seconds making hundreds of failed read attempts, then conclude the sector is bad, write to its firmware area (located on the platters) to update various logs, and finally respond with an error message, at which point the software data recovery tool can send the next read command. This process wastes time, quickly causes further physical degradation of the drive, and risks firmware corruption.
		        </p>
                            <p>
			If the drive has an internal exception when processing the bad sector — for example, while updating its firmware logs — it may not respond within a reasonable timeframe, causing the computer to freeze, restart, or drop the connection to the drive. To make matters worse, because the software tool has no direct connection to the drive, it may not be aware when the connection has been dropped. In that case, it will keep trying to recover data, but none of its attempts will actually reach the drive. After 20-30 seconds of idling, modern drives execute self-scans, attempting to seek out and reallocate bad sectors. This state quickly degrades the drive; entering it is one of the worst things that can happen to a degrading drive.
		        </p>
		        <span class="tit orange">RapidSpar: Exclusive drive access and control</span>
                            <p>
			RapidSpar has direct control of and exclusive access to drives. At every step of the recovery process, it uses proprietary software, firmware and hardware designed specifically to deal with unstable drives.
		        </p>
                            <p>
			If a drive does not respond to a read command within a fraction of a second, RapidSpar automatically uses hardware reset commands to force the drive to stop processing the bad sector. This alone eliminates the large majority of useless processing, and in most cases also stops the drive from registering bad sectors in its firmware logs, substantially decreasing the chances of serious damage. If a serious internal exception causes the drive to go offline, as a last resort RapidSpar automatically repowers it to continue the recovery process.
		        </p>
		        <span class="tit orange">Software tools: Slow and imprecise</span>
                            <p>
			Software data recovery tools tend to read data in large blocks of sectors (usually 4,096). This is mostly because of the large timing overheads imposed by the system architecture and by an inability to terminate bad sector processing. Reading in large blocks lets the tool use fewer commands to read the drive, reducing the consequences of using a complex architecture that isn’t designed for data recovery. If the drive fails to read a block, that entire block is usually forgotten — a loss of 4,096 sectors. Because a hard drive will fail to read a block if even a single sector within it is bad, thousands of good sectors remain unread, corrupting a larger number of files.
		        </p>
                            <p>
			Some Linux-based cloning tools can be configured to use small read block sizes and do multiple drive passes to retry missed blocks one sector at a time. These capabilities are severely restricted by all the architecture limitations cited above and only make sense using on mild cases of read instability. Using a small read block size has a serious side effect: the recovery process works at only 25% to 75% of the speed the drive is capable of (depending on the block size) because of timing overheads imposed by different layers of system software.
		        </p>
                            <p>
			In the same way, multipass imaging is only helpful for mild cases of read instability because, as with all data recovery software tools, there is no control over how bad sectors are processed, and every failed read attempt takes up at least a few seconds as a result. If just a few sectors are bad, this isn’t an issue; if there are more, the first pass will take such a long time that attempting secondary passes will not be practical or safe.
		        </p>
                            <p>
			Here’s a final limitation for Linux cloning tools: they can’t target specific files or folders for recovery. So they must take full drive clones, recovering countless unnecessary blocks of sectors, further increasing recovery time and the potential for something to go wrong.
		        </p>
		        <span class="tit orange">RapidSpar: Faster, with more data</span>
                            <p>
			An efficient architecture and the ability to quickly stop bad sector processing has a substantial impact — RapidSpar can often dig into an entire bad block one sector at a time before a software tool finishes waiting on a single failed read command.
		        </p>
                            <p>
			The RapidSpar architecture has very low timing overheads for processing of individual commands, so it can use a much smaller read block size, typically 256, without sacrificing speed. Blocks that fail to read can be retried one sector at a time to ensure that all good sectors within each bad block are recovered.
		        </p>
                            <p>
			RapidSpar understands file systems, allowing you to target critical file system information and then specific files and folders, usually eliminating the need for time-consuming full-drive cloning. As well, RapidSpar identifies exactly which files are corrupted by bad sectors, simplifying recovery validation.
		        </p>
		        <span class="tit orange">RapidSpar in action</span>
                            <p>
			This animation shows how RapidSpar and software tools recover the same unstable drive. We are assuming the software tool was able to correctly identify the drive and that every layer of the architecture involved in communicating with the drive is working flawlessly. In other words, it is a comparison between the absolute best-case scenario for software tools and an average case for RapidSpar. It is slowed down by 3 times to make it easier to understand:
